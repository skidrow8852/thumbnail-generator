A macro, highly detailed portrait of a Dalmatian dog's face, capturing every spot and fur texture. The dog has striking bright blue eyes that stand out against its black and white fur. The background is a solid pastel blue, slightly out of focus to keep the attention on the dog's face. The lighting is studio quality, highlighting the dog's features and giving the image a realistic and polished look.
